# NSFW Filter

[**NSFW Filter**](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter) is a web extension that blocks NSFW images from your browser.

When a web page is loaded, all the images remain hidden until they are found to be NSFW or not. If they are found to be NSFW, they remain hidden. Otherwise, they become visible.

***The extension runs completely on your browser. i.e No user data is being sent to a server for processing.***
